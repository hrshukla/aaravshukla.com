Dump trucks are vehicles that take away sand gravel and dirt.These trucks are mainly used in construction because there is a lot of dirt in a construction site that the trucks need to carry away.Dump trucks are mostly in India and Australia. Dump trucks have a hidralic pipe that lets the dump truck put the big bin up and down.

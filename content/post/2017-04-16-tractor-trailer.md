Tractor trailers are known as big rigs or 18 wheelers. There are many different types of trailers that a tractor pulls, like dumpers, flatbeds, car transporters, loggers, box trailers and tankers, that carry milk, water, diesel and petrol. A few people around the world call tractor trailers semi- trailer trucks or lorries. Sometimes they shorten semi-trailer truck by calling them semi- trailers or semi. Did you know that the largest truck in the world is a road train? They can carry 2 or more trailers in one go! Road trains are always found in Australia. These trucks have a very strong bullbar so when they bash into things there truck will not get damaged much.

_A long time ago,_ ___a lot of things were very different and today I, Aarav, am going to tell you about my favourite truck of all, it is a 1937 Ford   __pickup. This pickup is special to me because I have the toy 1937 Ford pickup at my house and its colour is dark green colour.  I got it from Mount Tambourine in a very awesome toy car shop and and I found them on  the bottom shelf  . It was an American classic truck   and even some other type of classics  were  really awesome. I really liked that they can open doors ,  pull of engine , and sometimes even   pull off the back tray or dumper if it can or if you have one. _

_The 1937 truck cost 850$ and it is a lot of money because all the comfortable seating and motors and other things that  have not even been invented yet. _

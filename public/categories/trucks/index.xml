      <description>Tractor trailers are known as big rigs or 18 wheelers. There are many different types of trailers that a tractor pulls, like dumpers, flatbeds, car transporters, loggers, box trailers and tankers, that carry milk, water, diesel and petrol. A few people around the world call tractor trailers semi- trailer trucks or lorries. Sometimes they shorten semi-trailer truck by calling them semi- trailers or semi. Did you know that the largest truck in the world is a road train?</description>

A long time ago, _a lot of things were very different and today I, Aarav, am going to tell you about my favourite truck of all, it is a 1937 FordÂ pickup. This pickup is special to me because I have the toy 1937 Ford pickup at my house and its colour is dark green colour. I got it from Mount Tambourine in a very awesome toy car shop and and I found them on the bottom shelf .</description>

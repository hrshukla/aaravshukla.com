A long time ago, _a lot of things were very different and today I, Aarav, am going to tell you about my favourite truck of all, it is a 1937 FordÂ pickup. This pickup is special to me because I have the toy 1937 Ford pickup at my house and its colour is dark green colour. I got it from Mount Tambourine in a very awesome toy car shop and and I found them on the bottom shelf .</description>
